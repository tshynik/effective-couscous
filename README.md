Simple TKinter GUI example for any Python data processing script.

## background
At work, I sometimes write Python scripts to modify plain text data files. I use Python when
1. The files are ludicrously large
2. The modifications are repetitive

It's not hard to change the infile name manually in a script, but sometimes I want to make these scripts more accessible for non-technical users.
